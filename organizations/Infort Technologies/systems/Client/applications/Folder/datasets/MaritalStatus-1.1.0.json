No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless: Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of \"unknown\". (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown') Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown. (E.g. specifying a use code of \"H\" and a URL prefix of \"tel:\" to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)"
